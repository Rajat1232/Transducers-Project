Smart Irrigation System ðŸŒ±
Overview
The Smart Irrigation System is an automated, data-driven solution that optimizes water usage based on real-time environmental conditions. Using Arduino and Python, the system monitors temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, controlling a water pump efficiently to minimize waste and enhance agricultural productivity.

Features
Automated Irrigation: Uses soil moisture levels to trigger water pumps.
Real-Time Monitoring: Displays temperature, humidity, and soil moisture on an LCD.
Python-Based Data Analysis: Generates real-time graphs and calibrates sensor readings.
Crop Recommendation System: Suggests crops based on environmental conditions.
Energy-Efficient & Portable: Operates on a 9V battery for remote areas.
Components Used
Sensors: DHT11 (Temperature & Humidity), Soil Moisture Sensor
Actuators: 5V Relay Module, DC Motor (Water Pump)
Microcontroller: Arduino
Power Supply: 9V Battery
Display: 16x2 LCD
Software & Languages
Arduino IDE (C++) â€“ Sensor interfacing & relay control
Python (Matplotlib, PySerial) â€“ Data analysis & visualization
Working Principle
Data Collection: Sensors measure temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.
Decision Making: If moisture is low, the Arduino triggers the water pump.
Data Display: Real-time readings shown on the LCD screen.
Python Integration: Live data is visualized and analyzed for optimization.
Crop Suggestion: Python recommends crops based on soil & climate data.
Results & Observations
Accurate moisture detection triggered irrigation at the right time.
Real-time graphs displayed environmental changes and sensor responsiveness.
Sensor sensitivity measured for precise calibration:
Temperature: 0.1 V/Â°C
Humidity: 0.05 V/%RH
Soil Moisture: -0.02 V/%
Future Improvements
pH Sensor Integration for better soil analysis.
Wi-Fi Connectivity to enable remote control via a mobile app.
Machine Learning for predictive irrigation scheduling.
How to Use
Upload the Arduino code to the microcontroller.
Run the Python script to visualize sensor data.
